# Check all PM2 processes
pm2 status

pm2 logs playwright

# Restart process
pm2 restart playwright

# Stop process
pm2 stop playwright

# Delete process
pm2 delete playwright

# Monitor processes
pm2 monit

# Save current PM2 configuration
pm2 save

# Setup auto-start on boot
pm2 startup
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
1. Check if port 3000 is available: `lsof -i :3000`
2. Check PM2 status: `pm2 status`
3. View logs: `pm2 logs playwright`

### PM2 Issues
1. Reinstall PM2: `npm install -g pm2`
2. Reset PM2: `pm2 kill && pm2 start npm --name "playwright" -- run server`

### Dependencies Issues
1. Clear node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json`
2. Reinstall: `npm install`

## Auto-Start on Boot

After running `./release.sh` or `./server.sh`, the server will automatically start when the system boots up. This is configured through PM2's startup system.

To disable auto-start:
```bash
pm2 unstartup
```

To re-enable auto-start:
```bash
pm2 startup
```
