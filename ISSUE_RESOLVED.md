   - Started fresh server instance
   - Verified port 3001 is now available

2. **Server Status**:
   - âœ… HTTP server responding on port 3001
   - âœ… WebSocket server accepting connections
   - âœ… Health endpoint working properly

3. **WebSocket Connection**:
   - âœ… Connection established successfully
   - âœ… Real-time monitoring active
   - âœ… Live Logs should show "Connected" status

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Status**

- **Server**: Running properly on port 3001
- **WebSocket**: Accepting connections

2. **Check Live Logs** - should now show "Connected" status
3. **Run a Playwright test** to see real-time command monitoring

- Real-time command logs in Live Logs section
- Formatted commands with environment variables:
  ```
  LOCAL=https://192.168.0.71:8000 USERNAME=testuser PASSWORD=*** npx playwright test --project=local
  ```
- Live updates as commands execute
