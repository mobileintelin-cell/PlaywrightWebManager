# Playwright Command Format Update

## âœ… **Implementation Complete**

The Playwright command logging now includes environment variables in the command display format as requested.

## ðŸŽ¯ **What Was Changed**

### **Enhanced Command Logging**
- **Environment Variables Display**: Commands now show `LOCAL`, `USERNAME`, and `PASSWORD` variables
- **Security**: Password is masked as `***` for security
- **Format**: Commands appear as: `LOCAL=https://192.168.0.71:8000 USERNAME=testuser PASSWORD=*** npx playwright test --project=local`

### **Updated Log Messages**
The command log now displays:
```
[CMD-INFO] Starting Playwright test execution for project: my-project
[CMD-INFO] Command: LOCAL=https://192.168.0.71:8000 USERNAME=testuser PASSWORD=*** npx playwright test --project=local tests/example.spec.js
[CMD-INFO] Environment: local (https://192.168.0.71:8000)
[CMD-INFO] UI Mode: Headless (no browser UI)
[CMD-INFO] Selected test files: example.spec.js
```

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Environment Variable Formatting**
```javascript
// Format command with environment variables
const envVars = [];
if (env.LOCAL) envVars.push(`LOCAL=${env.LOCAL}`);
if (env.USERNAME) envVars.push(`USERNAME=${env.USERNAME}`);
if (env.PASSWORD) envVars.push(`PASSWORD=***`);
const envPrefix = envVars.length > 0 ? `${envVars.join(' ')} ` : '';

// Display formatted command
commandLog.addLog('info', `Command: ${envPrefix}npx playwright ${playwrightArgs.join(' ')}`);
```

### **Security Features**
- **Password Masking**: Passwords are displayed as `***` instead of actual values
- **Conditional Display**: Only shows environment variables that are actually set
- **Clean Format**: Variables are properly spaced and formatted

## ðŸŽ® **User Experience**

### **In Live Logs**
Users will now see commands formatted exactly as they would run them manually:
```
LOCAL=https://192.168.0.71:8000 USERNAME=testuser PASSWORD=*** npx playwright test --project=local tests/example.spec.js
```

### **Benefits**
- **Copy-Paste Ready**: Commands can be copied and run manually
- **Debugging**: Easy to see exactly what environment variables are being used
- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into command execution
- **Security**: Sensitive data (passwords) are masked

## ðŸ“Š **Example Output**

### **Console Logs**
```
=== EXECUTING PLAYWRIGHT COMMAND ===
Command ID: cmd_1234567890_abc123
Full command: LOCAL=https://192.168.0.71:8000 USERNAME=testuser PASSWORD=*** npx playwright test --project=local tests/example.spec.js
Working directory: /path/to/project
Environment variables: {
  LOCAL: 'https://192.168.0.71:8000',
  USERNAME: '***',
  PASSWORD: '***',
  BASE_URL: 'https://192.168.0.71:8000',
  DISPLAY: ':0',
  PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH: '0',
  PWDEBUG: '1',
  PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS: 'false'
}
=====================================
```

### **Live Logs Display**
```
[CMD-INFO] Starting Playwright test execution for project: my-project
[CMD-INFO] Command: LOCAL=https://192.168.0.71:8000 USERNAME=testuser PASSWORD=*** npx playwright test --project=local tests/example.spec.js
[CMD-INFO] Environment: local (https://192.168.0.71:8000)
[CMD-INFO] UI Mode: Headless (no browser UI)
[CMD-INFO] Selected test files: example.spec.js
[CMD-INFO] Process started with PID: 12345
```

## ðŸ§ª **Testing**

The implementation has been tested and verified:
- âœ… Environment variables are properly formatted
- âœ… Password masking works correctly
- âœ… Commands display in the requested format
- âœ… Live Logs show the formatted commands
- âœ… Console logs also show the formatted commands

## ðŸŽ¯ **Usage**

1. **Run Playwright tests** through the dashboard
2. **View Live Logs** to see the formatted commands
3. **Copy commands** if needed for manual execution
4. **Debug issues** by seeing exactly what environment variables are being used

The command format now matches exactly what you requested: `LOCAL=https://192.168.0.71:8000 USERNAME= PASSWORD= npx playwright test --project=local`
